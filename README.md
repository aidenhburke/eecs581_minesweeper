## EECS 581 Project 1: Minesweeper
### Group & Team Structure:

### Roadmap:
- Set up backend functionality for storing the minesweeper board
  - Current to do:
  - Update board functionality to include flags, flagged cells cannot be uncovered until unflagged
  - display total flag/mine count, add timer
  - update win condition to check for a win after each successful click
    - have losses reveal all mines
  - maybe split board module into more granular modules and files
- Integrate that into UI and frontend through JS and Svelte
